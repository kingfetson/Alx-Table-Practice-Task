This project showcases a clean and accessible HTML table listing some of my favorite books. It demonstrates core HTML and CSS skills, including semantic markup, table structures, styling, and accessibility best practices.

## ✅ Features

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<caption>`, `<th>` with scope attributes.
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support using `aria-describedby`, meaningful captions, and clear structure.
- **Responsive & Clean Design**: Styled with modern, minimal CSS for readability and a pleasant user experience.
- **Table Functionality**:
  - Merged cells using `rowspan` and `colspan` to reduce repetition and improve clarity.
  - Alternating row colors to enhance visual separation of data.
  - Descriptive content to provide context about each book.
